This is a practice assignment for running test functions on a program

## Important files
* bank.cs -> The program itself
* UnitTest1.cs -> Contains all of the test functions for the program

## Program usage.
The program itself doesn't do anything noticable, to run the test cases, the user must open the Test Explorer and run the tests from there.
